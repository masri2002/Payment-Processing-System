## üöÄ Features

- **Stripe & Razorpay Integration** ‚Äì Seamlessly handles payments, notifications, and statuses via API integrations.  
- **Microservices Architecture** ‚Äì Decoupled, service-oriented design for payment processing and provider-specific logic.  
- **High Performance** ‚Äì Utilizes thread pools and optimized error-handling for reliability.  
- **Robust Security** ‚Äì Implements Stripe authentication and Spring security to safeguard payment data.  
- **Asynchronous Processing** ‚Äì Uses ActiveMQ for background communication within the system.  
- **Error Handling** ‚Äì Custom error codes and Spring Exception Handling for resilience.

## üéØ Responsibilities / Approach

- Designed RESTful APIs for payment flows (initiate, confirm, refund).  
- Analyzed Stripe docs and collaborated on integration strategy.  
- Implemented payment-status tracking to ensure 100% transaction reliability.  
- Encapsulated business logic in modular, provider-specific microservices.  
- Built the Stripe notification listener with unit tests.  
- Developed custom error codes and exception layers.  
- Applied Factory and Builder design patterns for modularity.  
- Managed persistence with MySQL via Spring JDBC.  
- Deployed on AWS EC2 using Secrets Manager for credential security.  
- Integrated ActiveMQ to decouple synchronous logic.
